# ðŸ“’ SMTP Field Manual

The SMTP Field Manual is a collection of raw SMTP server responses from major email service providers and spam filter services.

## Contribute

If you plan on making additions or edits to existing SMTP responses, youâ€™ll need to fork the repo and [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request). All of the data is stored as JSON in the [/data](https://github.com/activecampaign/smtp-field-manual/blob/master/data) folder. There's no need to set up the development environment for changes like this.

  - `nvm install`
  - `nvm use`
- `npm install`
- `npm install gatsby-cli -g`
- **ðŸš¨Admins onlyðŸš¨** Create a file named `.env` in the project root
  - Use [.env.example](https://github.com/activecampaign/smtp-field-manual/blob/master/.env.example) as a boilerplate
  - Reach out to [Derek Rushforth](mailto:drushforth@activecampaign.com) for API keys
